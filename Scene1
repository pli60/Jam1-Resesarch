=== Scene_1 ===
It’s time to purchase some new equipment for the dungeon exploration. You arrive at the town, Nagskur, a medium sized town which is famous for its blacksmiths and close distance with the dungeon.
You head towards the blacksmith. "Welcome young adventurer, what do you need?" says the blacksmith. "This is my first time entering the dungeon, maybe I should start with some basic equipment." {Scene_2: "The dungeon was not as easy as I thought it would be. I’m going to need better armor and weapon."} {Scene_3:"The bandits were a pain to deal with, I definitely need better equipment."}

    * I'll have the stone lance and the leather armor set.
        ~ Equipment = Stone
    * {Scene_2 or Scene_3} “May I have that iron lance and the iron armor set?”
        ~ Equipment = Iron


- “Sure, here’s your weapon and armor.” The blacksmith hands over your equipment.
