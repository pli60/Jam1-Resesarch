=== Scene_3 ===
{Scene_2: As you are heading back from the dungeon | As you are heading towards the dungeon}, a group of bandits come out of nowhere from the bushes and block your way. They are poorly equipped, some with no armor, some with no weapon.

{
- Bandit >= Known:
    You knew about the bandits, and you have already prepared yourself for the battle.
- else:
    You did not know about the bandits and haven’t equipped yourself for the fight.
}
“Hey kid, give me everything you got and I’ll allow you to leave without losing a limb.”
    * “Okay okay, I’ll give you what you wanted. Calm down.” You decide to settle things the easy way and hand over your weapon and armor to the bandits.
        -> Surrender
    *“No bloody way. If you want these, you’ll have to come and take them. Say less.” You get ready for a battle.
        -> Fight

===Surrender===
The bandits took everything you have and run away. Unlucky.

===Fight===
{
- Bandit == Known && Equipment != Unarmed:
    You defeat the bandits with the superior armor and weapon as well as the preparation you have.
    ~ banditstate = Defeated
- Equipment == Iron: 
    Even though you were unaware of the bandits, you easily defeat them with the superior armor and weapon you have.
    ~ banditstate = Defeated
- else: 
    Your courage is applaudable, however it is not a good idea to fight a group of bandits without any preparation. You are quickly overwhelmed because you are outnumbered. The bandits plunder every valuable item you have and leave you badly wounded

- banditstate == Defeated:
    Today is your lucky day, you faced bandits but left without losing anything.
- else: What a terrible day it has been. Robbed and wounded.
